    # include a preview box in text messages (preview_url: true), make sure the
    # URL starts with http:// or https:// â€”https:// URLs are preferred. You must

    # By default, WhatsApp recognizes URLs and makes them clickable, but you can
    # also include a preview box with more information about the link. Set this
    # field to true if you want to include a URL preview box. The majority of
    # the time, the receiver will see a URL they can click on when you send an
    # URL, set preview_url to true, and provide a body object with a http or
    # https link. URL previews are only rendered after one of the following has
    # happened: The business has sent a message template to the user. The user
    # initiates a conversation with a "click to chat" link. The user adds the
    # business phone number to their address book and initiates a conversation.
